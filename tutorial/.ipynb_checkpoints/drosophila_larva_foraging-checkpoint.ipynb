    "Larvae crawl on the substrate via forward (or reverse) periodic peristaltic strides. They can move faster or slower mainly by regulating the frequency of this periodic behavior, while the displacement achieved by a single stride remains constant (Hecksher,2012). The frequency range within which periodic activity can be maintained can be broadly constrained empirically, e.g. [0.5, 1.7] Hz ([0.3,0.8] Hz for reverse strides) for first instar larvae (Hecksher, 2012), while slower or faster rhythms have not been reported during  any instar stage. The displacement achieved during each complete stride is independent of the frequency and can be expressed as a portion of the total larva length. Reports on this displacement-per-stride parameter are indirect, spanning from 0.14 (Hecksher, 2012) to 0.4 (?), while . During a single forward stride, the velocity oscillation of any body part is stereotyped.  Finally, the stride cycle comprises of two phases, the visceral piston phase when head and tail actively move forward and the peristaltic phase when the rest of the segments move forward via a propagating wave. The former comprises a constant fraction of the entire cycle, e.g. 0.22-0.29 for first instars (Hecksher, 2012).\n",

    "Crawling is modeled as an oscillatory process at variable frequency f within a defined range. Depending on the implementation, the oscillatory signal can define the linear velocity / impulse / force of the head / tail / center of mass. A repetitive window of duration T=1/f is used, defining the time course of the chosen parameter during a single stride. The area-under-the-curve of the window is calibrated so that each stride results in a displacement equal to a given fraction of the current body length, defined by the displacement-per-stride parameter. In the simplest case  of linear velocity,  the area-under-the-curve equals the displacement for a single stride.\n",

    "It is not unreasonable to postulate that the displacement-per-stride parameter changes with larva age/experience/length. Correlation with length would imply a biomechanic mechanism while correlation with experience a motor learning process resulting in more efficient use of the body for locomotion. Another possibility is step-wise change after moulting events. The change of this parameter during larval life stage can be traced easily empirically. The dissociation of the aforementioned underlying mechanisms would be more challenging.\n"

    "\n",
    "Larvae bend the anterior part of their bodies through asymmetric ipsilateral contraction of their thoracic segments, resulting in a change in subsequent movement direction, therefore a turn in the context of a locomotion trajectory. This asymmetry is generated locally in the ventral cord during exploratory behavior and is independent of downward command signals from the brain (?). In most of the literature, turns are assumed to happen during discrete head-sweep events ,while the larva is stationary, and the turn amplitude is assumed to be normally or uniformly distributed within a given range of angles.  In contrast, empirical evidence recorded during innate chemotaxis  (Wystrach, 2016) suggest a continuous oscillatory process alternating between left and right bends which remains active both during stationary periods and during peristaltic strides. This process produces angular velocity oscillations of mean frequency around 0.3 Hz. This is in line with evidence suggesting common modulation of amplitude and orientation of turns during innate or learned chemotaxis (Thane, 2019).\n",

    "Bending is generated via a neural oscillator model introduced in (Wystrach,2016). Under baseline activation the resulting torque oscillations have a given frequency and amplitude. Additional excitatory (inhibitory) modulation shifts the oscillations towards higher (lower) frequency-lower (higher) amplitude torques. Depending on the body implementation, this torque is subsequently applied to the (anterior) body resulting in angular velocity via bending."
